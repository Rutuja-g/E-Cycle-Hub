# TODO: Add Start Shopping Button in cart.html When Cart is Empty

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Edit `public/cart.html` to include a static empty cart div inside the cart-list section, initially hidden.
- [ ] Modify `renderEmptyCart` in `public/js/cart.js` to show the static div instead of setting innerHTML.
- [ ] Update `renderCart` in `public/js/cart.js` to clear cart items without removing the empty div, and remove the code that adds the "Start Shopping" button when the cart is not empty.
- [ ] Test the cart page by loading it with an empty cart to verify the button appears.
- [ ] Test with items in the cart to ensure the button is hidden and items display correctly.
